# Write a function called "spiral" that takes an NxM array as input
# and returns a "spiral" path through the array, starting in the
# upper-left corner and moving clockwise. Use the language of your
# choice.

# For example (in Ruby), if

# array = [[1,2,3],          [8,9,4],          [7,6,5]] then

# spiral(array) => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] It should work on any NxM
# array, so don't assume the input is a square array. However, every
# row will have the same number of elements.
